# Indicating_Stock
Indicating Stock (Indock) is machine learning based project to Indicate Behaviour of certain stock.
I proposed to use the LSTM algorithm to provide efficient stock prediction.They used a Long short-term memory network (LSTM). Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” In which we calculate the 100 days and 200 days moving average closing price to calculate the future value of stock.The prediction methods can be roughly divided into two categories, statistical methods and artificial intelligence methods. Statistical methods include logistic regression model, ARCH model, etc. Artificial intelligence methods include multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, naive Bayes network, back propagation network, single-layer LSTM, support vector machine, recurrent neural network, etc. They used a Long short-term memory network (LSTM).
